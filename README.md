### A Discord bot built with Discord.Net  
Note: This bot is still very far from being complete and I'm currently just trying out different things. Don't expect it to be of much use to you yet. The Discord.Net documentation is still pretty incomplete right now for v1.0.0, so I'll probably wait a while before starting to do any complex things with this bot.

#### Get it working  
This bot is built as a .NET Core Console application using the Discord.Net (1.0.0-rc) NuGet dependency. The simplest way to get it running is probably to download Visual Studio 2017 and select the .NET Core module during installation.

To use the bot you also need to edit the 'ConfigExample.cs' file, instructions for that is located inside of the file itself.
